                            I am an Engineering Scinece student, majoring in Machine Intelligence at the University of Toronto. I just finished my third year of studies and am now in a PEY year since this May at the Intel Corporation in San Jose, California.
                            I am passionate about machine learning, its applications, and research development. 
                            Particularly, I am interested in how natural language processing or audio speech recognition can be used to improve daily lives and support physically or hearing-impaired people.

                    <h3>Machine Learning Audio/Speech Separation</h3>
                    <img src="../images/audio.png" alt="Audio Speech Separation Model">
                    <p class="content">Audio recognition is a still-developing, important technology that has a variety of applications, such as translation, transcription, and supporting hearing-impaired people. 
                        Speech-separation is an essential component of audio recognition technology, and it is a challenge that is still being researched. Hence, in a team of three, we aimed to create models that could separate an audio file that contained voices of two people speaking over each other into two separate individual speeches using machine learning.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">For this project, we first researched various methods and machine learning models other researchers or engineers used to improve speech-separation. 
                        We then decided to use an existing dataset called "<a href="https://github.com/philipperemy/timit/blob/master/README.md" title="TIMIT corpus" target="_blank"><i>TIMIT corpus</i></a>". This dataset includes individual-speech audio files. 
                        Then, we created the train, validation, and test datasets by overlying two audio files using <i>pydub</i>. 
                        Initially, we tried working with STFTs (short-time Fourier transform) for the audio data, but we later concluded that it will be more efficient working without the STFTs and complex audio waveforms.
                        We then explored various model architectures and combinations, including fully connected, 1D convolution, 2D convolution, RNN, GRU, and LSTM layers. 
                        During training, we also used various combinations of different loss functions, such as Kullback-Leibler, chamfer distance, mean-squared error, and reconstruction losses. 
                        Overall, the original audio file format and its complex nature were additional challenges in separating the audio, so our current best models have space for greater improvement.
                    </p>

                    <img class="img_ball_dispensing" src="../images/aer201.png" alt="Ball Dispensing Robot">
                    <p class="content"> With two other teammates, I responded to a Request for Proposal (RFP) to design and create a scaled-down prototype for an autonomous ball-dispensing machine for a manufacturing company. </p>
                    <p class="content">For this project, we first identified the objectives and requirements given.
                        Initially, we divided the tasks into mechanical, electrical, and microcontroller coding, each person getting one division.
                        I coded for a microcontroller and Arduino Nano to control the robot's actions and ball deployment, to implement user interface, and to incorporate I2C and UART communications protocols for Arduino. 
                        After each division was fairly completed, we integrated all the divisions into a functioning robot and tested the robot.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        We wrote proposals and reports to document our designs, literature research, milestones, task assignment, required materials, and cost analysis. 
                        Such was done through fomularizing design processes with PERT, Gantt, CPM, Morph, AHP, and utility function charts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        Our largest challenge was to make the robot go straight. 
                        Because there was no line or sign for the robot to follow, we tried implementing a compass and a gyroscope.
                        Ultimately, a gyroscope proved to be more accurate and efficient, but the accuracy could have been improved after more testing.

                    <h3>Bridge Design and Prototype Construction</h3>
                    <p class="content">During my first semester of the Engineering Science program, my two other teammates and I designed and created a model railway bridge using matboard and contact cement that could hold certain loads specified in the provided Request for Proposal (RFP). 
                    We identified the problem, developed our objectives, and managed project milestones.</p>
                    <p class="content">According to the requirements provided, we brainstormed creative design options. <img src="../images/bridgeIdea.png" alt="Diverged Ideas for the Bridge">
                    We came up with various different designs of the bridge (diverging) as shown on the right.
                    We then proceeded to consolidate such design options and found one design that was robustly supported by calculations, which tested how much stress and force the potential design could withstand. </p>
                    <p class="content">Next, we created a prototype (shown on the right) for the bridge by cutting a matboard and gluing the pieces with precision derived from our calculations. 
                    <img src="../images/bridge.png" alt="Prototype Bridge">
                    We were, therefore, able to use both mathematical and physical models to justify our convergence towards one design because with the limited resources, it was essential for us to optimize the design and to not waste resources. 
                    From this project, I realized how confirming the precision of mechanical work while creating the physical prototype is a necessary step towards ensuring the usability and performance of the design.</p>

                        Some times, people are either too tired to focus or have to multitask during online meetings. 
                        Hence, as a team of four, we created a web application that automatically and simultaneously transcribes and summarizes meeting notes for the user. 
                        Also, the web app will notify the user by making a sound when the user's name is called by other people in the meeting or when the user is required to speak. 
                        The summarized meeting notes will let the user to quickly scan to obtain info so that the user can immediately join the meeting efficiently when needed.

                        Coming up with efficient parking strategies is an on-going challenge for urban planning. 
                        The University of Toronto Engineering Kompetition (UTEK) addressed this challenge.  
                        As a team of four, we designed a scaled-down prototype of a parking mechanism.

                    <p class="content">
                        I participated in the University of Toronto Robotics Association Hackathon (UtraHacks), which is a hardware hackathon. 
                        There, three other members and I designed and created an electric drumming set that includes two drums and a pedalling drum.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        The set can be used in multiple different ways; as a gaming tool that can be found at the game centers or as a learning tool for people who want to learn how to use the drum set. 
                        The design detected the hits using force sensors.

                        Additionally, we developed an LED-and-Arduino mechanism that indicates which part of the drumming set should be hit to play a particular song or pattern. 
                        We programmed the mechanism so that the drumming sets can be used not only as a learning tool by indicating which hit was wrong and interactively guiding which hit to do, but also as a game with various functions that includes keeping the correct hits by displaying the numbers.

                    <p class="content">
                        After Japan was hit by the earthquake in 2011, large tsunami destroyed many areas near Fukushima. 
                        Many people strove to revive the cities and welcome back the residents and tourists. 
                        One of such people established Itnav, which is an organization that combines innovation and development (Itonamu in Japanese) with the mission of educating people from Ishinomaki city, which was heavily damaged by the tsunami, to create over 1000 technologiests/engineers by 2021, which is 10 years after the Tohoku Earthquake and tsunami in 2011.
                        Right after the earthquake and tsunami in 2011, they noticed that Ishinomaki is a rural city with fewer opportunities for children especially in the field of technology and engineering. 
                        Hence, they hold various workshops, talk series, and teach at elementary to high schools. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        Every year, Itnav also hosts an overnight three-day hackathon for people who are interested in technological development.
                        In 2016, I participated in the hackathon as one of the teaching member for a class with mostly high school students and a few adults who were interested in developing mobile applications. 
                        Because the class was an introductory class for coding and used CoronaSDK as the main language to code, I first quickly picked up the language, as I have never heard of the language before.
                        After I got used to the CoronaSDK language, other teachers and I collaborated in creating an online textbook that described various significant coding concepts and algorithms that could be used to create mobile applications.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content">
                        The most memorable moment during this hackathon was helping a student to create a mobile application that supported speech-impaired people to communicate with others. 
                        He himself was physically and speech impaired and passionately wanted to support such people.
                        Working with him and seeing his strong passion for creating and using such technology to improve others' lives inspired me to study engineering and coding.

                    <h3>Analysis and Predictions of the Compositions of Exo-Planets</h3>
                    <p class="content">Since the beginning of my undergraduate life, I have been assisting research for Prof. Diana Valencia in the Department of Astronomy in the University of Toronto.</p>
                    <p class="content">For this project, I have been programming models using <i>Python</i> to predict the compositions and habitability of exoplanets by solving systems of differential equations and equations of state along with data provided by other researchers.
                    I use Python libraries, such as <i>NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, Plotly, Matplotlib</i>, and <i>Pandas</i> to analyze, interpolate, and present such predictions. 
                    Additionally, I worked with melting curves (graphs) for materials that compose exo-planets, specifically identifying and interpolating when such materials change their phases. 
                    Such work ultimately resulted in decreasing computation and research times by about 10%.</p>
                    <p class="content">I worked on this project during the summer of 2019 as well and received the Engineering Science Research Opportunity Program (ESROP) Award for funding.</p>

                    <h3>Exemplifying Physics/Engineering Discoveries/Theories by Creating Educational Demos</h3>
                    <p class="content">I worked in the Faraday Lab under Prof. Anjam Khursheed in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore during the summer of 2018.</p>
                    <p class="content">There, I first researched various theories/technologies and different methods the engineers used to create innovations or inventions. 
                    Since one of the objectives of this project was to create demos using readily available materials, I also researched and tested many materials/components that could be used to develop such technologies in the most cost effective way. 
                    Ultimately, I developed several engineering and physics demos using mechanical skills, such as using CAD (Fusion360) to design, laser cut materials, and soldering connections and electronics based on the research I conducted. </p>
                    <p class="content">The demos would be used to introduce such technologies to young people to inspire them to appreciate such innovations and to demonstrate famous experiments/theories/inventions in polytechnic/university courses.
                    For this project, I received the Engineering Science Research Opportunity Program Global Summer Experience Award for funding.</p>

                    <h3>SMA-Driven Caterpillarlike Soft-Worm Robot</h3>
                    <img src="../images/Imomushi.jpg" alt="Soft-Worm Robot with SMA Wires">
                    <p class="content">While I was interning in the Asami & Kawahara Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, I re-designed a soft-worm robot that enabled the removal of SMA (a shape-memory alloy, a wire that goes back to its original shape when heated) from the plastic body and created an instruction manual for the robot.</p>
                    <p class="content">After developing an understanding of the soft-worm robot that my mentor had been working on, I made sure that I was familiar with the assigned problem and expected requirements. 
                    I then started coming up with ideas on how to open holes that can help make the SMA lines detachable.​
                    After deciding on one design, which was validated by my mentor, I used CAD (Fusion 360) to design the physical prototype and operated a 3D printer to print out the prototype. </p>
                    <p class="content">I then coded and set up Arduino UNO so that the changes of the SMA lines’ shapes are "remembered."
                    Since the purpose of this project was to communicate soft robot technology ideas to a wider audience and to create a kit that can be commercialized, I created <i><a href="https://medium.com/open-softmachines/three-sma-driven-caterpilike-recipe-3b3db9c07575" title="Instruction Manuals" target="_blank">soft-worm robot instruction manuals</a></i> in both Japanese and English.</p>
